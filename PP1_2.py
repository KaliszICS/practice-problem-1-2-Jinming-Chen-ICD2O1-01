def q1():
# Assign the name "Alex" to the variable named name. Output its value.
name = "Alex"
print("name")# Output: Alex

def q2():
# Assign the integers 3, 5, and 2 to three different variables with different names. Output their sum (add them together).
a = 3
b = 5
c = 2

num= a + b + c
print("num")# Output: 10

def q3():
# Assign the integers 21 and 4 to two different variables. Output the quotient (rounded down, no decimals).
a = 21
b = 4

num = a // b
print("num")# Output: 5

def q4():
# Assign the floating point numbers 6.3 and 3.0 to two different variables. Output the exact quotient (result of the division problem).
a = 6.3
b = 3.0
num = a / b
print("num")# Output: 2.1

def q5():
# Assign the value "Hello World" to a variable. Output it. Replace the value of the variable with "Goodbye World". Output it.
word = "Hello World"
print("word")# Output: Hello World

word = "Goodbye World"
print(word)# Output: Goodbye World

def q6():
# Assign the value True to a variable. Output it.
word = True
print("word")# Output: True

def q7():
# Assign the values ​​7 and 2 to two different variables. Output the remainder of the first variable (7) divided by the second variable (2).
a = 7
b = 2
num = a % b
print("num")# Output: 1
